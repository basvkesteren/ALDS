    Getting started

Program-execution will start in the file crt0.S, which contains the startup-code. From there the main() function is called,
which is located in the file main.c. This function will initialise most of the hardware, after which the function usercode()
is called in user.c. This is where the actual functionality (the 'usercode') should be placed. Read this file for some more
information and some example-code.
    The folder 'drivers' contains code for most of the onboard perhiperals of the LPC21xx MCU's. For each perhiperal class there
is one header file(located in the 'include' folder), whilst each perhiperal has it's own C file (for example, there is one uart.h
file, but also uart0.c and uart1.c. uart.h contains the definitions for both uart0 and uart1).
Some driver files contain configuration parameters. They always include some comments about what they do, so do read
those if you want to change them.
    The folder 'drivers/board' contains some board specific code; read the files for details. Including <board.h> includes all the code available
for the board in use (which is configured in config.h, setting BOARD)
    The folder 'scripts' contains scripts and configuration files needed for the JTAG debugging. You generally do not need
to change these files.
