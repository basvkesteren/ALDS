    Debugging

Here are some notes on the new debugging stuff (openOCD).

1. Always make sure the MCU you compiled the code for matches the MCU your actually using. openOCD won't check this and happily load it anyways
   (and in some cases it can even work (partly))
2. For flash debugging, the program must be loaded and running on the target before you start 'make debug'. If the program is not loaded,
   or not running, GDB will hang on the console window.
   It would be fairly easy to automate the loading, so a call to make debug would load and debug. However, this can cause a lot of unneeded
   flash writes (what if you want to debug a file thats already loaded in the target?), so the loading is left as a task for the user.
   So, to limit unneeded flashwrites, and to keep this stuff flexibel, I decided for the current approach.
   NOTE: flash loading using openOCD (as make load does) is somewhat unreliable. You're better of using the serial bootloader stuff.
